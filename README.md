# QuickReserve
QuickReserve is a web-based reservation management system developed using Java and the Spring Boot framework. The project is designed to automate and streamline the process of making and managing reservations for various services or resources. Built as a Maven project and structured for development in Eclipse IDE, QuickReserve uses Spring Boot Web to create RESTful APIs and Spring Data JPA to interact with a relational database. The application integrates MySQL as its primary database for persistent storage and also includes an H2 in-memory database for testing and development purposes. The backend architecture is developed using Java 17, ensuring compatibility with modern enterprise environments. Organized into well-defined source and resource directories, the project supports scalability, modularity, and maintainability. Overall, QuickReserve provides a solid foundation for implementing real-time reservation systems with robust data handling and efficient serviceÂ management.
